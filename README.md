# CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python

## About the Project

This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and experiments from **CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python**, offered by **Harvard University**.
The course introduces students to the foundations of computer science and programming logic through the **Python** language, emphasizing **problem-solving**, **clean code**, and **computational thinking**.

## Key Features

* Learn the fundamentals of **Python syntax** and **control flow** (conditions, loops, and functions).
* Work with **data types** such as strings, lists, dictionaries, and sets.
* Explore **file I/O**, **regular expressions**, and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
* Implement **unit testing** using `pytest` to ensure code correctness.
* Solve **real-world inspired problem sets** designed to strengthen logic and critical thinking.
* Develop a **final project** integrating all learned concepts.

---

## Technologies

* **Python 3**
* **pytest** (for testing)
* **CS50 Library** (for input handling and validation)

---

## Purpose

This repository documents my learning journey through the **CS50P** course.
It represents the transition from basic Python understanding to writing structured, efficient, and well-tested code.
Each week builds upon the previous one, progressively introducing new concepts, challenges, and best practices for software development.
